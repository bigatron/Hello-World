# Hello-World
This is my first repository
I have been coding for a couple of years off and on and have made a website that is still live right now, but could probably use some updates.  I am starting to look at webdesign as more of a career option now as I have gone freelance recently and I would like to branch into new work fields.  Since I have some experience with html, css and the basics of javascript I felt like this was a good way to go.  I am looking forward to starting this new chapter in my career.
